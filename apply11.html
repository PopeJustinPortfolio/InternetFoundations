                <p> Building credit is much easier than it may seem. In the long term, you want to make sure you only 
                    borrow what you can afford and make sure you pay your balance in full. It might take some time,
                    however, slowly and surely your credit score will increase. Eventually, if you know you can afford more,
                    you can have multiple credit cards. Be sure to do the same as you did with one; only borrow what you know
                    you can afford and make sure you pay them off in full AND on time.
                </p>
